					Achkan is a knee-¬length traditional men’s jacket, similar to a Sherwani What makes it different from the other styles of Sherwani is its light fabric. It is a long-¬sleeved Rajasthani jacket with a breast pocket on the left-hand side, reaching down to the knees & buttoned in front, up to the neck. It is worn in the northern parts of India and Pakistan. An Achkan exhibits a ceremonial and regal aura. It is generally worn to weddings but can make a splendid style statement for occasions like parties, social banquet gatherings, and even fashion shows. Also, if wearing it, one can team the outfit with various accessories to complement the attire. A pearl necklace is worn to enhance the look of an Achkan. In addition to this, one can wear a bracelet or a ‘Kara’, or a finger ring, or a designer watch to complete the look.
